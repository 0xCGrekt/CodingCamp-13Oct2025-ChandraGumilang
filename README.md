# CodingCamp-13Oct2025-ChandraGumilang
This To-Do List Web Application was developed as part of a Mini Coding Assignment for the RevoU CODING CAMP.

Key Features:
- Task Management (Full CRUD): Comprehensive functionality to create, read, and delete tasks, with persistent data storage using Local Storage.
- Efficiency: Features Search, Status Filtering, and Pagination for efficient list management.
- Task Status: The Status button (Pending/Completed) indicates the task's condition. Clicking this button toggles the task's status (from Pending to Completed, and vice versa).
- Edit Task: The Edit button launches a modal, allowing users to modify the existing task text and due date.
